I want to be able to write notes into a file and keep it encrypted with a passphrase, so only the one who knows it can read them.

encrypted-journal v1:
CLI utility with 2 commands: encrypt, decrypt

Expected outcome:
- Encryption
1. Write something into a text file.
2. Call `jcrypt enc file.txt`
3. New file file.txt.enc is created (the encrypted version)
4. Prompt the user "Delete the original file?"
- Decryption
1. Call `jcrypt dec file.txt.enc`
2. Prompt the user for a passphrase.
3. New file file.txt is created (in case of an already existing file with the same path prompt the user for a new name or override the current file).
